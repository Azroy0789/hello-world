# hello-world

I'm too helpless to learn coding. This is my first journey.

Hi everyone, my name is Roy. This is my first journey to thr GitHub. 

I heard about this site since many years ago, but i never understand on how to use it.

I graduated with Honors Degree in Architecture, but my passion for information technology 
fuels up my motivation to further my journey into IT, especially coding.

I tried to learn myself throught various sites and book, but somehow it didn't show up much 
improvement. I typically failed.

So i starts to venture into networking world starts with Cisco, then explore into Huawei, 
Juniper and Arista & Mojo technology. 

There is a saying that, programmer can easily learn networking but network enginner will have 
a difficulties to learn coding programming. 

Since there will be cloud automation, to learn coding with python will be the next valuable skills 
for network engineer to automate network intergration. 

So from Architect into Technology Evangelist. That is my dream. 

Hello World, this is me, Azroy Mansor.
